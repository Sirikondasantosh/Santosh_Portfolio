# How to Add Your Profile Photo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save your image** as `profile-photo.jpg` in the `/Users/santoshsirikonda/santosh-portfolio/` directory

2. **Image requirements:**
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Size: Recommended 300x300 pixels or larger
   - File name: `profile-photo.jpg`
   - Location: Same folder as `index.html`

3. **Alternative file names** (if you prefer):
   - `santosh-photo.jpg`
   - `profile.jpg`
   - `avatar.jpg`

## How to Update the File Name:

If you use a different file name, edit `index.html` and change this line:
```html
<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Santosh Sirikonda" class="avatar-img">
```

To your actual filename:
```html
<img src="your-filename.jpg" alt="Santosh Sirikonda" class="avatar-img">
```

## Image Optimization Tips:

- **Crop to square**: The image will be displayed as a circle
- **High quality**: Use a professional headshot
- **Good lighting**: Ensure your face is well-lit
- **Professional attire**: Business casual or formal wear works best

## Current Setup:

✅ HTML updated to use real image instead of icon
✅ CSS styled for circular profile image
✅ Hover effects added
✅ Responsive design included

Once you add the image file, your professional headshot will automatically appear in the skills section!
